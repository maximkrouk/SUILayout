# SUILayout

Sometimes it's pretty annoying to type something like `.frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity)` , so I decided to extract common cases to this tiny framework.

## Usage

```swift
var body: some View {
Text("Awesome SwiftUI Layout")
.make.equalToScreen()
}
```

Avalible cases:

- `make.equalToScreen()`
- `make.equalToSuperview()`
- `make.square(length: Length)`

New capabilities will come soon ðŸ˜‰
